# Phase 6 — Evaluation Harness

This phase adds a minimal evaluation harness to exercise recursion, tool usage,
reviewer loops, and trace output.

## What’s Implemented
- `examples/eval_harness.py` defines a small suite of hierarchical prompts and prints
  structured trace/memory outputs for manual inspection.
